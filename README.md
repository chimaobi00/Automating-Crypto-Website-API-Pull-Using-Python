# Automating-Crypto-Website-API-Pull-Using-Python
### Overview:

This project involves automating the retrieval of cryptocurrency data from a website's API using Python. By leveraging automation techniques, we streamline the process of fetching real-time cryptocurrency information and storing it for analysis or display. The project aims to provide users with a convenient and efficient way to access up-to-date cryptocurrency data for various purposes, including trading, analysis, and research.

### Features:

Automated retrieval of cryptocurrency data from website API.
Support for multiple cryptocurrencies and exchange rates.
Customizable parameters for data retrieval (e.g., time interval, specific cryptocurrencies).
Simple and intuitive Python code for easy customization and extension.


### Dependencies:

Python 3.x

Requests library

Pandas library


### Usage:

Open the crypto_api_pull.py Python script in your preferred editor.
Customize the script to specify the website API endpoint, desired cryptocurrencies, time interval for data retrieval, and any other parameters.
Run the script to initiate the automated retrieval of cryptocurrency data from the website's API.
The retrieved data will be stored in a Pandas DataFrame for further analysis or processing.
Utilize the retrieved cryptocurrency data for trading strategies, market analysis, visualization, or any other use case.
